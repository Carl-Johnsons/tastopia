Instead, it is marinated with fermented bean curd as a key ingredient in the sauce, along with garlic, vinegar, apple, and carrot, which give it its signature golden color. Its flavor is fruity, refreshing, and rich, making it a perfect pairing with rice, noodles, or grilled dishes. It’s light, tasty, and adds a refreshing touch to any meal!",

Salads are great, but you will fall in love with this vegan recipe once you try it. The key to making tender and savory radish is braising. Braising is a common cooking method in Asian kitchens. Similar to stewing, you cook with medium-low heat for a longer time. ",
